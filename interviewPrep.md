#Interview Preparation


# Emily To Do:

- Pick a language to do all your prep and interviews in.

# Data Structures

## Queue

Implement with a linked list and array.

## Stack

Implement with a linked list and array.

## Linked List

## Heap

## Hashmap

- only need to know rough understanding of implementation
- i would learn the array one with linked lists to handle collision.

## Graph

- directed/undirected

## Binary Search Tree

- How do you find a value in a binary search tree?

# Complexity (big O)

Try and get familiar with the runtimes of the things listed here.

# Algorithms

## Graph

- DFS
- BFS

## Trees

- in/pre/post/level order traversal. Try to solve each of these with recursive and iterative solutions. (post order is really hard iteratively.

## Sorting

- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- mergesort
- quicksort

## Searching

- binary search
